Company will not reimburse Vendor for any travel or entertainment expenses unless expressly agreed by Company in writing in advance. There will be no other charges for the services to be provided under the applicable SOW except for those fees and expenses expressly stated in that SOW, which will include all applicable taxes or other related charges. Vendor acknowledges and agrees that Company will have no obligation to make any payment to Vendor that has not been pre-authorized and pre-approved by Company in writing.
Delivery and Acceptance. Except as otherwise agreed by Vendor and Company in the applicable SOW, the following provisions will apply for delivery and acceptance of any Deliverables provided hereunder. The standard for acceptance for Deliverables will be material conformity to the specifications set forth in the Specifications and as otherwise expressly communicated by Company.
Company will accept or reject the initial version and any corrected version of each version of any Deliverable, and will notify Vendor in writing of any error, deficiencies or inadequacies in the version.
If Company rejects the initial version or any corrected version of any work, Vendor will immediately commence using its best efforts to correct such error and will have a period of at least 5 business days from receipt of the written rejection to correct all errors, deficiencies or inadequacies specified by Company and submit a revised draft.
Vendor and Company agree that upon delivery by Vendor of an accepted version of any Deliverable, Company will have 30 days to test the Deliverable and determine whether it has been delivered to its reasonable satisfaction. On or before the last day of such 30 day period, Company may provide Vendor with written notice that final acceptance has occurred (“Final Acceptance”). If Company does not provide such notice, the parties will either agree to a revised timeframe during which Final Acceptance may occur, or may submit the dispute for resolution in accordance with this Agreement.
All source code and other files with respect to any Deliverables that may be edited will be placed by Vendor on the server location designated by Company.
Upon Final Acceptance of any Deliverable, all object code, together with all final source code, designs and other files and materials will be released by Vendor to Company and uploaded to the server location designated by Company (“Final Delivery”). Vendor acknowledges and agrees that Final Delivery will not be deemed complete unless and until all final versions of files and materials relating to each Deliverable, including but not limited to all images, videos, font types and other applications, have been provided to Company in a format that is fully editable and capable of being modified by Company or other third parties without further involvement by Vendor and without requiring use of a password or other code or method that has not also been provided or identified to Company.
